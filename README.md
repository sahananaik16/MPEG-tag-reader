# MPEG-tag-reader
An MPEG tag reader project is designed to extract and display metadata from MP3 audio files, such as the song's title, artist, album, and more. These tags are typically stored in two formats: ID3v1 and ID3v2. ID3v1 tags are simple and located in the last 128 bytes of the MP3 file, containing fixed-length fields for metadata like title, artist, and album. On the other hand, ID3v2 tags are more complex and found at the beginning of the file, allowing for variable-length frames that store more detailed and flexible metadata, such as album art or lyrics. The program would open the file in binary mode, seek to the appropriate position for each tag type, read the data, and then display it in a human-readable format. The project highlights core C programming concepts like file I/O, string manipulation, and dynamic memory management.
